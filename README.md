# LinkUp

LinkUp is a real-time chatting application building using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It aims to allow users to connect with each other and engage in real-time conversations. With LinkUp, you can create chat rooms, send messages, and interact with other users seamlessly.
